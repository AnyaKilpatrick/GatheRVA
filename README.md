#Project Overview

We started with the problem statement: “What is there to do next weekend in Richmond?”; this is near and dear to our hearts as we have all experienced this

We created a user interface for finding music/food & beverage/festivals/active activities and also delivered the capability to create your own events in the Richmond area

Utilized APIs to pull images, event locations, date/times, descriptions, and weather

Captured user data for create your own section using Firebase Database and Firebase Storage

#Applications/APIs/Programs Used

Active API – Athletic events, such as running, cycling, triathlons, etc.

AJAX – To pull data from API

Bootstrap – Formatting of cards

Eventful API – Music, food & beverage events, festivals, etc.

Firebase Database – To store collect user input

Firebase Storage – To store user’s created event pictures

JavaScript/HTML/CSS/jQuery

JSON – To format API responses and create requests

Willy Weather Widget – So user can determine type of activity or event

Imbedded video 

#Design Process

Came together to design the user experience and details that were must haves; user experience was our primary focus throughout this journey

Researched appealing color combinations to arrive at palate used in project

Along with our in-class time we also met out of class twice and used Slack/Trello to communicate about updates

Landed on using Bootstrap card instead of a list so that the content is displayed in a unique way

Researched multiple APIs before landing on a few where we could return meaningful data


#Future Development

We wanted user created events to be moderated by other users, but weren’t able to deliver; would like to add this at a later date

We use the file name to access firebase storage but multiple files could be named the same thing; we want to include another way to index it

We are able to allow user created events to add photos, but wanted to include those photos in the cards; we aren’t able to pull those photos from Firebase Storage currently, we want to resolve this

Want to improve the design of our modal in future iteration
